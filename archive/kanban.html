                <p>As a Pedagogy Fellow in American Studies, I worked to support our interdisciplinary community of teachers through designing and leading the G3 pedagogy class, hosting various individual workshops, and providing one-on-one consultations. Some of my major accomplishments include revamping our pedagogy colloquium to better suit the needs of American Studies students, developing programming to address questions of diversity and inclusion in the classroom, and respond to emergent needs wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some issues that arose were mainly related to the decentralized nature of the American Studies program, as well as the pandemic. I endeavored to solve these issues through connecting students with Bok Center resources and making myself available as a mentor and advocate. People essential to my role as a PF included Bok Center staff, other PFs, and program staff/faculty/students/alumni. For the future, I hope PFs will continue to address the evolving needs of their programs and be attentive to new teaching conditions caused by major events like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                <p>My goal for the 2019-2020 academic year was to convert a series of pedagogy workshops into a required course for graduate students in Anthropology. Building from the previous Pedagogy Fellow’s work, I wrote a syllabus which covered the need-to-know basics of teaching in anthropology and beyond. As a “half course” for G2s before they begin TFing, the class met eight times throughout the semester, and assignments struck a balance between useful but not burdensome. I also built the course Canvas site, which serves as a repository for resources, links, bibliography, and schedules of pedagogy-related events in the future.</p>

                <p>The precise role of the Pedagogy Fellow, and the standards and expectations for the Teaching Workshop organized by this person, have always been a bit unclear in my department. Because of this, I set out to provide a clear series of recommendations for my successors to maximize the impact of the position, which I feel has a great deal to contribute to the culture of the department. I suggest a plan for maintaining institutional memory, and provide a series of recommendations regarding the department’s requirements, and for communicating these requirements to students and faculty alike.</p>

                <p>One of our key responsibilities is to help run the G1 pedagogy course and support their first teaching assignments. Last year, we refined the process of giving feedback using a Google Form and matching feedback guidelines and saw a positive response to this structure both years. Building on this, we wanted to expand our efforts to support TFs in later teaching terms, including upper level course TFs and head TFs. We had the opportunity to assist all TFs with the transition to remote teaching by creating a repository for helpful resources and helping organize the distribution for online teaching hardware. </p>

                <p>Pedagogy by Design is based on pedagogical methods like "backwards design" or "understanding by design," whereby you identify your goals and then plan accordingly. It also captures the notion that seemingly simple "design" elements--for example, when a course meets, how long it lasts, how it is organized--can have a big impact on course success. Combining these two ideas, I had the goal of making the Classics Teaching Colloquium more useful and I accomplished this by implementing some seemingly small design changes, but those changes ended up having a big impact on the G3s' experience of the colloquium this year. </p>

                <p>As a Pedagogy Fellow in Comparative Literature, I helped teach the “Professing Literature” seminar, organized new pedagogy events for the department including a UPAF presentation on “An Introduction to Harvard Undergraduate Identities,” and hosted workshops on teaching writing in Junior and Senior Tutorials. In a recent workshop, a timeline like the one linked above generated new insights into our undergraduate curriculum. For example, we noticed that the Junior Tutorial has only two formal assignments during the Fall and early Spring, and we now plan to create a database of model assignments for graduate student teachers to implement in their tutorials.</p>

                <p>This document is an outline of an introduction to accessible education workshop that was supposed to be offered in March but was unfortunately cancelled due to the pandemic.  It is intended to introduce participants to accessible education, connect them to further resources, and hopefully motivate them to learn more.  The first half of this workshop seeks to introduce participants to disability at Harvard, what accommodations are, and how AEO functions.  The second half invites them to reflect on their own teaching and how they might be able to make their classrooms more inclusive with Universal Design for Learning.</p>

                <p>The purpose of my capstone project, an ongoing Canvas website titled Pedagogy in English, is twofold. For G3s in English becoming first-time Teaching Fellows, Pedagogy in English serves as the full course website for the required pedagogy seminar English 350: Teaching and Professional Development Colloquium, complete with overviews of weekly topics, assignments, relevant links, sample teaching materials, and pedagogy resources. And for English graduate students at any stage of their careers, Pedagogy in English offers an evolving repository of readings, sample teaching and job materials, FAQs, and links to resources inside English, across the university generally, and outside of Harvard.</p>

                <p>My goal this year was to institutionalize the major changes that I have made to our department pedagogy course so that future PFs can make adjustments but do not have to start from scratch on building out a curriculum. I expanded the number of required sessions for our pedagogy course, developed a series of "choice" sessions for TFs to chose from, and added in explicit connections to inclusion and equity into each session. My Capstone project consists of a scope and sequence with organized spaces for documenting successes and challenges for each session. I also created a timeline of tasks to help future PFs communicate early and often about pedagogy course expectations.</p>

                <p>The Harvard History Department Teaching Colloquium provides an opportunity to generate enthusiasm, awareness, and buy-in about practices of intentional and reflective teaching. The course is required for first-time Teaching Fellows (TFs). The timing of the graduate program means that TFs are juggling a variety of new dissertation-research-related commitments simultaneous to teaching at Harvard for the first time. Given this context, alongside a disciplinary preference in History for starting with primary sources, the instructional approach in Teaching Colloquium this year emphasized in-class work with actual examples of pedagogical materials, including but not limited to: sample undergraduate essays; history-specific active learning exercises developed by other instructors; and real History syllabi.</p>

Within this backdrop, the Departmental Pedagogy Fellow is challenged to reimagine their vision of how best to strengthen and augment these existing resources.

                    Much of the work I did this year built on the foundations laid by my predecessor, including providing support to the pedagogy course and organizing small workshops.  In addition to continuing these efforts, I also created and clarified teaching resources to address contemporary issues, such as new requirements and new positions.  I hope this will bolster the latitude of initiatives undertaken by future Pedagogy Fellows, and usher in novel perspectives to confront the perennial challenges of awareness and engagement. "</p>

My hope is that present and future TFs might find it useful, perhaps add to it, maybe begin repositories for musicology, ethnomusicology, even composition, and possibly even make it interactive with links to scores and sound files.  Think of how encyclopedically knowledgable we'll all look to our students when we can furnish off the top of our head 6 examples of French-augmented 6ths chords resolving to Cadential V4-3 suspensions!</p>

Changes to the program are based on my own experiences teaching the current iteration of it in the Fall of 2019 as well as feedback from NELC TFs who have taken the course. Employing core principles of pedagogy such as backward design and active learning, each of these sessions seek to instill a core set of teaching tools whose value and purpose will be clearly recognizable and reinforced. Notable changes also include shifting the requirement from the stressful G3 year to the Spring of G2 and introducing more NELC faculty-led sessions to inspire enthusiasm for pedagogy and build rapport among the department’s students and faculty.</p>

                <p>Talk like Ted: workshops that take you from the lab to the stage. Every 4th year OEB graduate student is required to present their research at a department-wide symposium during the spring of their G4. In preparation for the symposium, I created several workshops to help with public speaking and presentation preparation. These included sessions on oration, ﬁgure design, and practice talks. A scientist’s ability to give a good talk in front of an audience is no longer just a fortuitously advantageous skill. Truly, the art of clearly telling a story and engaging listeners is integral to success in the research world. These workshops were designed not only to entice graduate student attendance, but provide tools applicable to all areas of science communication.</p>

                <p>The function of this capstone project is two-fold. First, it provides a teaching-fellow-centered website aimed at helping teaching fellows prepare and manage discussion sections (especially courses dealing with ethics). The website provides TFs with backwards-design approach to discussion sections, guiding TFs through the process of selecting learning goals for their discussion sections and finding appropriate strategies for those goals. It also allows TFs to organize strategies by common classroom circumstances and needs. Second, by providing teaching-fellow-centered resources (like the website), this project seeks to encourage philosophy TFs to use existing resources to help build a repository of pedagogical resources.</p>

                <p>Extensive research on pedagogical practices has underscored time and again the importance of diversity, inclusion, and belonging in classrooms. This capstone project seeks to explore how one can learn from these studies and develop strategies applying this knowledge to everyday teaching, in order to circumvent the problems associated with non-inclusive environments. We also discuss ways of disseminating information about inclusive teaching methods and building awareness thereof, in the context of the Harvard Physics department.</p>

                <p>Instructional Styles in Psychology is a year-long course that all 3rd year psychology graduate students are required to take concurrently with their first year of teaching. The main goals of the course are to provide practical and emotional support for TFs teaching for the first time and to provide opportunities for them to practice, develop, and reflect upon their skills as teacher. These goals are primarily accomplished through classroom discussions, assignments, and guest lectures.</p>

                <p>Second language pedagogy theory in practice is the principle that guided our work this year. We served as teaching assistants in two pedagogy courses that introduced new instructors to research and theory in second language acquisition. We prioritized building a strong community of collaboration while supporting instructors with observations, recordings, and feedback meetings. We supported new instructors transitioning to remote teaching with weekly meetings to share best online teaching strategies. We shared sample lessons adapted to online teaching with the Language Center. Finally, we helped instructors develop their reflective practice through a panel on teaching and the academic job market.</p>

                <p>Opportunities to practice teaching exist in varied forms at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, from the practical, such microteaching sessions and the SEAS Teaching Practicum, to the conceptual, such as pedagogy journal clubs. Here we summarize takeaways from such initiatives this past year, with a focus on concrete suggestions for future Pedagogy Fellows. We propose ideas for a prospective course on the hidden curriculum of graduate school, and skill development workshops applicable to teaching and research alike. We also discuss lessons learned from the transition to remote instruction, and tips shared with current Teaching Fellows that could translate to future online classroom settings.</p>

                <p>My capstone project is a timeline that will hopefully serve as the basis to create a structured pedagogy course in Slavic. I suggest starting by introducing four workshops a year: focusing on teaching in the Fall, professional development in the Spring. Additionally, I started a G2 shadowing program. The idea is to introduce G2s to teaching more gradually, providing them with a space to ask questions and get more information about what to expect in the Fall, and giving them the opportunity to observe some language classes and literature sections taught by their colleagues who are G3s and up.</p>

                <p>This project showcases an effort to rethink the “hot moments” exercise new TFs do every year in the Department of Sociology’s teaching practicum. The examples in the curriculum, and the design of the exercise, were years old, and it became apparent some of the language was foot-in-mouth. I wrote new examples and altered the format of the exercise. My hope is that future PFs in the department will continue to audit and rework various elements of the teaching practicum's curriculum.</p>

                <p>This year, we made changes to the pedagogy class in the Department of Statistics based on three themes: 1) Teaching in statistics in a big data world, in which we added themes to microteaching sessions to address the need of teaching coding and communicating with different audiences. 2) Integrating resources, in which we brought in pedagogy content from various sources. 3) Adapting to remote teaching, in which we modified classroom activities into offline assignments to allow for more flexibility in the online learning environment. We believe these changes updated the course in meaningful and relevant ways.</p>

                <p>In the politically polarized context of contemporary America, university students and instructors can struggle to manage classroom ideological conflict. Students wish to engage in meaningful discussion around contentious topics, and pedagogical literature suggests avoidance is harmful. Yet Teaching Fellows may feel ill-equipped to respond to challenging discussion topics, particularly when in ideological disagreement with students. In this capstone project, I survey Harvard undergraduates regarding their experiences with ideological conflict in the classroom. I draw on their stories to develop a one-page resource sheet for Harvard TFs. In the future, these efforts could be expanded through a training workshop which draws upon these and other students’ experiences.</p>

                <p>This project involves cataloging experiences of moving learning activities online in Spring 2020. This semester provided a unique scenario where both students and faculty did not sign up for online teaching but were thrown into the situation unexpectedly. This is markedly different than when a course is originally designed to be taught online. The project aims to add to the Bok Center's existing resources about teaching online by providing examples of how students and teachers have experienced this semester's unique transitions. </p>

The details it gathers could help departments as they prepare for the possibility of remote teaching in Fall 2020 and in their broader efforts to develop durable programs of pedagogical support for TFs.  I hope that it serves as a useful tool for reflecting upon and recording the realities of our online teaching in the current moment—and that it contributes to conversations about the value of such reflection for future moments of in-person teaching as well.</p>

Public Speaking and Communication in Context.”  As a teacher of new teachers, I’ve focused this year on training graduate students to work seriously on improving their methods of communication by: one, envisioning teaching as public speaking that varies according to the social context in which it’s done; two, practicing leading seminar-style dialogues in lieu of monologues (lectures); and three, taking risks and experimenting with novel pedagogies such as Pre-Texts, which radically decenters and destabilizes traditional structures of authority in the classroom.</p>
