                <h1>The Pedagogy Fellows Program</h1>

                <p>The Bok Center’s Pedagogy Fellows Program supports Harvard graduate students in their roles as undergraduate teachers. Approximately thirty experienced and creative graduate student teachers per year serve as Pedagogy Fellows, who collaborate with faculty, administration, and the Bok Center’s senior staff to enhance training and support for teaching fellows within their departments and across the FAS. <br><br>The Bok Center’s training prepares the Fellows for the many facets of their roles: they serve as liaisons between the Bok Center and their programs, consult with TFs, lead pedagogy seminars and workshops, and develop resources on teaching and professional development for their peers. Fellows gain the opportunity to grow in their own careers as teachers and scholars, and become more reflective about their disciplinary values and the ways in which they communicate with colleagues and students.</p>
